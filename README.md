An attempt to arrange chord diagrams for the mandolin by song key.

I'm learning the mandolin, which is a fun instrument to play.  (Actually it turns out they are all fun to play.)
Most books and online references group chord diagrams by the root note of the chord, showing you, for example,
Cmaj, Cmaj7, Cmin in one place.  But you never play all those chords one after the other in an actual song.
Actual songs are in key signatures, and within a key, there are standard progressions which tell you the
_next_ chord to play.

For example, in the key of Cmaj, the seven chords are (I) Cmaj, (ii) Dmin, (iii) Emin, (IV) Fmaj, (V) Gmaj, 
(vi) Amin, and (VII) Bdim.  If you are playing a song and playing a Cmaj chord, you're probably not going to play Cmin
next, but Fmaj or Dmin are pretty good candidates.  So what we need is a chordbook arranged by song key.

I can't find this book.

But I did find the LaTeX `gchords.sty` package that lets me typeset chord diagrams.
